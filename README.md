# ComS-228-Convex-Hull

# 1. Project Overview
In this project, you are asked to implement Graham‚Äôs scan and Javis‚Äô march to construct the
convex hull of an input set of points in the plane, and compare their execution times. For a
description of the algorithm, please refer to the lecture notes ‚Äúconvex-hull.pptx‚Äù on Monday
Mar 19th

We make the following two assumptions:
a) All the input points have integral coordinates ranging between ‚àí50 and 50.
b) The input points may have duplicates.
In a), integral coordinates are assumed to avoid issues with floating-point arithmetic. The
rectangular range [‚àí50, 50] √ó [‚àí50, 50] is big enough to contain 10,201 points with integral
coordinates. In b), duplicates may appear since the input points will be either generated as
pseudo-random points or read from an input file.
The classes PureStack and ArrayBasedStack were from one of the lectures and should not
be modified. Also, no need to modify the classes Segment and Plot.

# 1.1 Point Class
The Point class implements the Comparable interface. Its compareTo() method compares the
ùë¶-coordinates of two points first, and then their ùë•-coordinates only in case of a tie.

# 1.2 PointAngleComparator Class
Point comparison can be also done using an object of the PolarAngleComparator class, which
you are required to implement. The polar angle is with respect to a reference point stored in the
instance variable referencePoint. The compare() method in this class must be implemented
using cross and dot products not any trigonometric or square root functions. You need to
handle a special situation where multiple points have the same polar angle. Please read the
Javadoc for the compare() method carefully.
The class PolarAngleComparator has a second instance variable flag used for breaking a tie
between two points which have the same polar angle with respect to referencePoint. When
flag == true, the point closer to referencePoint is considered ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù; when flag == 
false, the further point is considered ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù. The two values of flag will be set for
Graham‚Äôs scan and Jarvis‚Äô march, respectively.

# 2. ConvexHull Class
Convex hull construction is implemented by the abstract class ConvexHull, which has two
constructors:
public ConvexHull(Point[] pts) throws IllegalArgumentException
public ConvexHull(String inputFileName) throws FileNotFoundException,
 InputMismatchException
The first constructor takes an array pts[] of points and copy them over to the array points[].
The array pts[] may consist of random points, or more precisely, points whose coordinates are
pseudo-random numbers within the range [‚àí50, 50] √ó [‚àí50, 50]. (Random point generation is
described in Section 6.)

The second constructor reads points from an input file of integers. Every pair of integers
represents the ùë• and ùë¶-coordinates of a point. A FileNotFoundException will be thrown if no
file with the inputFileName exists, and an InputMismathException will be thrown if the file
consists of an odd number of integers. (There is no need to check if the input file contains
unneeded characters like letters since they can be taken care of by the hasNextInt() and
nextInt() methods of a Scanner object.)
For example, suppose a file points.txt has the following content:
0 0 -3 -9 0 -10
8 4 3 3
-6 3
-2 1
10 5
-7 -10
5 -2
7 3 10 5
-7 -10 0 8
-1 -6
-10 0
5 5
There are 34 integers in the file. A constructor call ConvexHull(‚Äúpoints.txt‚Äù) will initialize
the array points[] to store 17 points below (aligned with five points per row just for display
clarity here):
(0, 0) (-3, -9) (0, -10) (8, 4) (3, 3)
(-6, 3) (-2, 1) (10, 5) (-7, -10) (5, -2)
(7, 3) (10, 5) (-7, -10) (0, 8) (-1, -6)
(-10, 0) (5, 5) 
Note that the points (-7, -10) and (10, 5) each appears twice in the input, and thus their
second appearances are duplicates. The 15 distinct points are plotted in Fig.1 using
Mathematica.
There is a non-negligible chance that duplicates occur among the input points, whether they are
from the input file or randomly generated from the range [‚àí50, 50] √ó [‚àí50, 50]. For a fair
comparison between Graham‚Äôs scan and Javis‚Äô march, both assuming their input points to be
distinct, all the duplicates should be eliminated before the convex hull construction. This is done
by the constructors via calling the method removeDuplicates().
The method removeDuplicates() performs quicksort on all the points by ùíö-coordinate. After
the sorting, equal points will appear next to each other in points[]. The method creates an
object of the class QuickSortPoints to carry out quicksort using a provided
Comparator<Point> object, which invokes the compareTo() method in the class Point. After
the sorting, identical points will appear together, and duplicates will be easily removed. Distinct
points are then saved to the array pointsNoDuplicate[] with the element at index 0 assigned
to lowestPoint.
Fig. 1. Input set of 15 different points.
In the previous example, quicksort produces the following sequence:
(-7, -10) (-7, -10) (0, -10) (-3, -9) (-1, -6)
(5, -2) (-10, 0) (0, 0) (-2, 1) (-6, 3)
(3, 3) (7, 3) (8, 4) (5, 5) (10, 5)
(10, 5) (0, 8) 
The two (-7, -10)s appear together, so do the two (10, 5)s. After removal of duplicates,
the remaining points are copied over to the array pointsNoDuplicate[]:
(-7, -10) (0, -10) (-3, -9) (-1, -6) (5, -2)
(-10, 0) (0, 0) (-2, 1) (-6, 3) (3, 3)
(7, 3) (8, 4) (5, 5) (10, 5) (0, 8)
The variable lowestPoint is set to (-7, -10).
The array pointsNoDuplicate[] will be the input of a convex hull algorithm. The class
ConvexHull has an abstract method constructHull() which will be implemented by its
subclasses to carry out convex hull construction using either Graham‚Äôs scan or Jarvis‚Äô march.
public abstract void constructHull();
The vertices of the constructed convex hull will be stored in the array hullVertices[] in
counterclockwise order starting with lowestPoint.
.
  
# 3. Convex Hull Construction
Two algorithms, Graham‚Äôs scan and Jarvis‚Äô march, are respectively implemented by the
subclasses GrahamScan and JarvisMarch of the abstract class ConvexHull. Both subclasses
must handle the special case of one or two points only in the array pointsNoDuplicates[],
where the corresponding convex hull is the sole point or the segment connecting the two points.
3.1. Graham‚Äôs scan
The class GrahamScan sorts all the points in points[] by polar angle with respect to
lowestPoint. Point comparison is done using a Comparator<Point> object generated by the
constructor call PolarAngleComparator(lowestPoint, true). The second argument true
ensures that points with the same polar angle are ordered in increasing distance. (In case your
previous implementation did not work well, this is a chance to make it up. ) The compare()
method must be implemented using cross and dot products not any trigonometric or square root
functions. (Please read the Javadoc for the compare() method carefully.)
Point sorting above is carried out by quicksort as follows. Create an object of the
QuickSortPoint class and have it call the quicksort() method using the
PolarAngleComparator object mentioned in the above paragraph. The comparator uses
lowestPoint as the reference point. Note that quicksort has the expected running time
ùëÇ(ùëõ log ùëõ) and the worst-case running time ùëÇ(ùëõ
2
), which will respectively be the expected and
worst-case running times for this implementation of Graham‚Äôs scan for convex hull construction.
Sorting is performed within the method setUpScan(). In the array pointsNoDuplicate[], (-
1, -6) and (5, -2) have the same polar angle with respect to (-7, -10). That (-1, -6) appears
before (5, -2) is because it is closer to (-7, -10). 
Graham‚Äôs scan is performed within the method constructHull() on the array
pointsNoDuplicate[] using a private stack vertexStack. As the scan terminates, the
vertices of the constructed convex hull are on vertexStack. Pop them out one by one and
store them in a new array hullVertices[], starting at the highest index. When the stack
becomes empty, the elements in the array, in increasing index, are the hull vertices in
counterclockwise order.
3.2. Jarvis‚Äô March
This algorithm of the gift wrapping style is implemented in the class JarvisMarch. There are
three private instance variables.
private Point highestPoint;
private PureStack<Point> leftChain;
private PureStack<Point> rightChain;
The algorithm builds the right chain from lowerestPoint to highestPoint and then the left
chain from highestPoint downward to lowestPoint. Two stacks, leftChain and
rightChain, are used respectively to store the chains during the construction. The convex hull
vertices on the stacks are later merged into the array hullVertices[].
The convex hull construction is described with more details in the PowerPoint notes ‚Äúconvex
hull.pptx‚Äù. At each step, the method
private Point nextVertex(Point v)
determines, given the current vertex v, the next vertex to be the point which has the smallest
polar angle with respect to v. In the situation where multiple points attain the smallest polar
angle, the one that is the furthest from v is the next vertex. Hence, the comparator used in this
construction step should be generated by the call PolarAngleCompartor(v, false).
  
# 4. Display the Convex Hull
The constructed convex hull will be displayed using Java graphics package Swing. The display
will help you visually check that the constructed convex hull. The fully implemented class Plot
is for this purpose. A few things about the implementation to note below:
ÔÇ∑ The JFrame class is a top level container that embodies the concept of a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù. It
allows you to create an actual window with customized attributes like size, font, color,
etc. It can display one or more JPanel objects in the same time.
ÔÇ∑ JPanel is for painting and drawing, and must be added to the JFrame to create the
display. A JPanel represents some area in a JFrame in which controls such as buttons
and textfields and visuals such as figures, pictures, and text can appear. 
ÔÇ∑ The Graphics class may be thought of like a pen that does the actual drawing. The
class is abstract and often used to specify a parameter of some method (in particular,
paint()). This parameter is then downcast to a subclass such as Graphics2D for
calling the latter‚Äôs utility methods.
ÔÇ∑ The paint() method is called automatically when a window is created. It must be
overridden to display your drawings.
The outputs by the two convex hull algorithms are displayed in separate windows. For display,
a separate thread is created inside the method myFrame() in the class Plot.
Please do not modify the Plot class for better display unless you understand what is going on
there. (Anyway, the quality of display will never match that created by software like
Mathematica or Matlab.)
The class Segments has been implemented for creating specific line segments to connect the
input points so you can see the correctness of the sorting result.
The output of each algorithm can be displayed by calling the partially implemented method
draw() in the ConvexHull class, only after constructHull() is called, via the statement
below:
Plot.myFrame(pointsNoDuplicate, segments, getClass().getName());
where the first two parameters have types Point[] and Segment[], respectively. The call
getClass().getName() simply returns the name of the convex hull algorithm used. From
hullVertices[] you will generate the edges of the convex hull as line segments and store
them in the array segments[]. This can be done by iterating through the elements in the array
in one loop. Do not forget to generate a segment connecting the last element with the first point
at index 0, that is, lowestPoint.
For the example in Section 2, the array segments[] contains 5 segments below (where each
element is shown as a pair of points):
((-7, -10), (0, -10))
((0, -10), (10, 5))
((10, 5), (0, 8))
((0, 8), (-10, 0))
((-10, 0), (-7, -10))
Fig. 2 displays the convex hull constructed over pointsNoDuplicate[] for the same earlier
example.

# 5. Comparing Convex Hull Algorithms
The class CompareHullAlgorithms executes Graham‚Äôs scan and Jarvis‚Äô march on points
randomly generated or read from files. If the input points are not from an existing file, , its
main() method calls the method generateRandomPoints() to supply an array of random
points Over each input set of points, the method compares the execution times of these
algorithms in multiple rounds. Each round proceeds as follows:
a) Create an array of randomly generated integers, if needed.
b) For each of GrahamScan and JavisMarch, create an object from the above array or an
input file.
c) Have the two created objects call the construcHull() method and store the results in
hullVertices[].
Below is a sample execution sequence with running times. Use the stats() method to create
a row for each sorting algorithm in the table.

# 6. Random Point Generation
To test your code, you may generate random points within the range [‚àí50, 50] √ó [‚àí50, 50].
Such a point has its ùë•- and ùë¶-coordinates generated separately as pseudo-random numbers
within the range [‚àí50, 50]. You already had experience with random number generation from
Project 1. Import the Java package java.util.Random. Next, declare and initiate a Random
object like below
Random generator = new Random();
Then, the expression
generator.nextInt(101) ‚Äì 50
will generate a pseudo-random number between -50 and 50 every time it is executed.
